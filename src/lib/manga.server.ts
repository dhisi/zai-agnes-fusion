  "technique or visual genre because the image renderer applies one fixed style separately. You are given a " +
  "character bible and the COMPLETE script (Hindi/Hinglish/English), every line numbered with its timestamp. You are " +
  "then asked for a set of line numbers. For EACH requested number write ONE English image prompt that draws EXACTLY " +
  "WHAT THAT LINE LITERALLY DESCRIBES.\n" +
  "TIMESTAMP FIDELITY (absolute): the prompt for a numbered line must show THAT line's own moment and action. Never " +
  "draw a different timestamp or blend two timestamps into one image. Story continuity is equally absolute: unless " +
  "that line explicitly changes place, time or cast, retain the established location, time of day and active characters " +
  "from the immediately preceding lines. A new sentence is not a new scene. Resolve Hindi/Hinglish pronouns such as " +
  "वह, उसके, उसकी, उसे, उन्होंने and English he/she/they from the surrounding lines and write the resolved character's " +
  "NAME in the prompt. Never replace an active character with an empty room or landscape.\n" +
  "EVERY prompt must contain, in this order: (1) the place/setting the line itself describes, (2) who or what is in " +
  "frame — with bible traits woven inline ONLY for characters the line itself is about; if the line involves no person, " +
  "the shot has no people at all, (3) the exact action, body pose and facial expression, (4) 4-6 concrete environmental " +
  "details, (5) the most effective cinematic camera angle, shot size, composition and perspective for this exact beat, " +
  "chosen from wide shot, medium shot, close-up, extreme close-up, over-the-shoulder, low angle, high angle, side angle, " +
  "Dutch angle or dramatic foreshortening according to the action and emotion, " +
  "(6) the natural lighting and colour the line implies.\n" +
  "RULES:\n" +
  "- CHARACTER IDENTITY: never impose an age, gender, relationship status or other demographic on the protagonist or " +
  "any character. Preserve such details only when the script or user-written character sheet explicitly provides them.\n" +
  "- ONE LINE = ONE IMAGE (absolute): exactly one prompt per requested number, in the same order, never merged, never " +
  "split, never skipped, never a placeholder. Each prompt must be visibly DIFFERENT from its neighbours.\n" +
  "- NOTHING INVENTED (absolute): every person, place, object, prop and event in the prompt must come from the script — " +
  "from the requested line itself, from its neighbouring lines, or from the character bible. Never invent a room type, " +
  "building, institution, machine, vehicle, furniture, clock time, weather or event the script never mentions (no " +
  "'investigation room', 'office', 'laboratory' or similar unless the script says so). If the line does not state a " +
  "place, reuse the last place the SCRIPT itself stated — never a new one you made up. Before writing, translate the " +
  "Hindi/Hinglish line to yourself and make sure every noun and verb of that translation is visible in your prompt; if " +
  "your prompt could not be recognised as a drawing of that exact line, rewrite it.\n" +
  "- LITERAL SUBJECT (the most important rule): draw the visible event happening at THAT timestamp and nothing else. " +

  "First classify the line. If a named person says, tells, explains, warns, asks, answers, thinks, remembers or learns " +
  "information, show that present speaker/listener interaction and its emotion — DO NOT illustrate nouns inside their " +
  "speech or thought as if those events are happening now. For example, a woman warning someone about an army shows " +
  "the woman warning them in the established room, not a lineup of soldiers. Only draw demons, a massacre, a city, " +
  "an army, a war or a past event directly when the timestamp explicitly presents it as visible action, a clearly " +
  "introduced flashback, or detached historical narration with no present speaker. Never replace a conversation with " +
  "the topic being discussed.\n" +
  "- SCENE CONTINUITY: default to the same location, time and active cast as the previous line. Change them ONLY when " +
  "the current line explicitly names a different location/time/cast or clearly begins a flashback, memory, dream or " +
  "separate narrated event. Keep continuing actions spatially coherent: the same room layout, doors, furniture and " +
  "character positions should remain recognisable while pose, expression and camera angle advance.\n" +
  "crowds, villagers, strangers or unnamed people show THOSE people — never insert a main character into them.\n" +
  "- CAST RESOLUTION: put every bible character named in the current line in frame. Also retain a bible character when " +
  "the current line uses a pronoun or continues that character's action from the preceding line. Write every resolved " +
  "character by NAME and repeat their sheet traits. Lines explicitly about soldiers, demons, crowds, villagers, " +
  "strangers or unnamed people show those people instead of unrelated main characters.\n" +
  "crowds, villagers, strangers or unnamed people show THOSE people — never insert a main character into them.\n" +
  "- A memory, flashback, dream or story-within-the-story is drawn as the remembered event itself, in the place and " +
  "time it happened, not as someone remembering it.\n" +
  "- LIGHTING & COLOUR: direct the lighting to support the exact story beat while preserving the established time and " +
  "place. Calm moments may use soft light; tense, violent, emotional or mysterious moments may use harder separation, " +
  "dramatic shadows, rim light or intense colour accents. Keep faces and essential action readable. Name the light source " +
  "and dominant colours, and never change day, night or weather without script support.\n" +
  "- RICH DETAIL (critical): every prompt is dense with concrete visual detail — at least 4-6 specific drawable things " +
  "in the environment; for each person the posture, hand position, exact expression (eyes, eyebrows, mouth) and " +
  "clothing state. Foreground, midground and background must each have something drawn in them.\n" +
  "- STAGING & GAZE (critical): stage each character according to the exact action and emotional beat. Use natural body " +
  "orientation, interaction, gesture, weight distribution and gaze direction, with dynamic poses for movement or conflict. " +
  "Walking looks like walking, attacks show committed attack mechanics, falls show lost balance, fear creates defensive body " +
  "language, anger creates aggressive posture, shock creates a full reactive pose, and conversations use natural interaction. " +
  "People are absorbed in the action; nobody poses for the viewer unless the line itself requires it.\n" +
  "- ALWAYS A SCENE, NEVER A DESIGN: every prompt is one continuous location with a full background — floor, walls or ground, sky or ceiling, and 4-6 props. Never write a reference sheet, model sheet, character design, turnaround, multiple views, a lineup, a floating head, an isolated portrait on a plain backdrop, a duplicated copy of the same character, or an empty blank background.\n" +
  "- CARRY THE SCENE FORWARD: begin from the place, time of day and cast already established by the previous lines, and say that place explicitly in this prompt even if the line does not repeat it.\n" +
  "- Weave a character's fixed traits INLINE (e.g. 'Henan, a thin 17-year-old boy with messy jet-black hair, sits...'). " +
  "NEVER write a separate character description block, sheet, reference, lineup or 'plus portrait of'.\n" +
  "- CONSISTENCY: when a bible character DOES appear, repeat their bible traits (hair, eyes, clothing colours) using " +
  "the bible's own words. Never redesign, re-age or re-dress a character between shots.\n" +
  "- THE CHARACTER BIBLE IS APPEARANCE REFERENCE ONLY. Never turn its wording into the panel's action, setting or " +
  "composition. The timestamped script alone decides what happens. First describe the exact visible story action and " +
  "location; attach fixed appearance traits only to the people actually present.\n" +
  "- NEVER SUBSTITUTE SCENERY FOR A HUMAN MOMENT: if a line names, quotes, remembers, describes, follows or uses a " +
  "pronoun for a person, that person must be visibly present performing the line's action. An empty room, empty road, " +
  "empty field or landscape is valid only when the line explicitly establishes an unoccupied place.\n" +
  "- IDENTITY CONTINUITY: preserve age, gender and other identity details when they are explicitly supplied by the " +
  "script or character sheet; when absent, leave them open rather than guessing.\n" +
  "- TWO OR MORE PEOPLE IN FRAME (critical): name each person separately with their own " +
  "their own distinct traits, and say where each one stands. Never write 'two figures' or 'the two of them', and " +
  "never let one character's hair, clothing, age or body type bleed onto the other.\n" +
  "- DISTINCT CAST (critical): when two people share a frame, preserve each person's explicitly supplied traits and " +
  "make their silhouettes, hair, clothing and position clearly distinct without inventing demographic traits.\n" +
  "- HEAD COUNT: state explicitly how many people are in frame and that nobody else is present.\n" +
  "- FIGHTING & MAGIC (critical): these stories are action fantasy. Whenever the line contains combat, a technique, a " +
  "spell, an awakening, a transformation, a curse, an aura, a summon, a beast, a weapon clash or any supernatural " +
  "ability, the prompt MUST describe it as visible drawable energy and motion: the exact stance and mid-motion body " +
  "mechanics of every fighter (which foot forward, which arm extended, where the fist/blade/palm is), the precise " +
  "shape, colour and direction of the power (for example 'jagged violet lightning spiralling up his right forearm and " +
  "bursting forward in a cone'), the point of impact, and the physical consequence in the environment (cracked ground, " +
  "shattered stone, torn cloth, dust ring, splintered trees, displaced air, scattered debris, blood, sweat, cuts). " +
  "State the eyes glowing or not, the aura around each body, the speed lines implied by the pose, and where each " +
  "fighter's gaze is locked. Copy each character's own established ability, weapon and power colour from the bible and " +
  "the earlier script lines so the same ability always looks the same; never give a character a power the script did " +
  "not give them. Also describe the battlefield itself in full — terrain, weather, sky, surrounding structures, " +
  "onlookers if the line has them — so the fight reads as happening in a real place at that exact timestamp.\n" +
  "- ACTION CHOREOGRAPHY (critical): for every physical action explicitly direct ACTION, POSE, BODY ROTATION, WEIGHT " +
  "SHIFT, DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT, CAMERA PERSPECTIVE, FOREGROUND ELEMENT, IMPACT POINT, ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE and FACIAL " +
  "EXPRESSION. Use clear silhouettes, foreshortening and a decisive peak-action instant. A punch, for example, must show " +
  "the torso twisting, rear foot driving, arm extending, fist prominent in foreground, target and impact point aligned, " +
  "and dust or debris reacting where appropriate rather than two characters standing near each other.\n" +
  "- COMPLETE MANHWA STORYTELLING: compose every image like a finished vertical Korean webtoon episode panel, with " +
  "confident cinematic crops, expressive acting, purposeful negative space for lettering, strong depth, and clean visual flow. " +
  "Use wide establishing compositions, intimate close-ups, extreme detail crops, tall reveals, offset subjects, foreground occlusion, " +
  "border-breaking action and quiet breathing space as the story requires. Never default to a centred waist-up character.\n" +
  "- WEBTOON EFFECTS: select only effects that strengthen this exact beat. Action may use speed lines, impact bursts, " +
  "directional streaks, motion blur, debris, dust, shockwaves, exaggerated motion, energy or slash trails and impact " +
  "distortion. Emotion may use subtle background rays, tension lines, dramatic shadow, eye emphasis, atmospheric particles " +
  "and emotional accents. Power or fantasy may use established aura, energy particles, glow, magic circles, elemental " +
  "trails and environmental reaction. Do not write an SFX word yourself; the renderer adds one script-matched action SFX. " +
  "Never describe lettering in the prompt body; spoken words and story narration go only in their dedicated tail fields.\n" +
  "- CAMERA & COMPOSITION: choose the camera specifically for the current story beat; never repeat one fixed shot type. " +
  "Use wide shots for geography and large-scale action, medium shots for interaction, close-ups for facial emotion, extreme " +
  "close-ups for intense reactions, low angles for power, high angles for vulnerability or scale, over-the-shoulder shots " +
  "for conversations, dramatic perspective and foreshortening for attacks, and Dutch angles for instability or tension. " +
  "The camera must serve the story beat while the established location remains recognisable. Treat neighbouring timestamps as a visual sequence: " +
  "alternate wide, medium, close and extreme-detail views; alternate left, centre and right subject placement; change camera height and foreground layer. " +
  "Two consecutive prompts must not use the same shot size, angle, crop or subject placement unless the script explicitly holds on an unchanged view.\n" +
  "- SETTINGS ARE FAITHFUL AND REPEATED (critical): describe each place exactly as the script has it, plainly and " +
  "simply, with no invented spectacle. Add only fantasy or magical features the script itself establishes. The FIRST " +
  "time a place appears, fix 4-6 concrete physical facts about it (wall and floor material and colour, one or two " +
  "windows or doors and where they are, 2-3 pieces of fixed furniture or landmarks, and the direction the light comes " +
  "from). For EVERY later line that stays in that same place, repeat those same physical facts in the same words — the " +
  "place must read as one single unchanged room or location across all its panels, with only pose, expression and " +
  "camera angle changing. Never redesign, re-furnish, rescale or restyle an established place, and never swap it for a " +
  "grander version of itself.\n" +

  "- One continuous scene, one place, one instance of each character. Never ask for insets, collages or a character sheet; frame splitting is decided ONLY by the FRAMES tail below.\n" +
  "- NO-CHARACTER LINES (critical): if the line describes only a place, an object, the sky, weather or a phenomenon and " +
  "involves no person, the prompt MUST be a pure environment shot with NOBODY in it. Start it with 'Empty environment " +
  "shot, no people:'. Never add a silhouette, an onlooker or a main character just to fill the frame.\n" +
  "- CROWD LINES: if the line says many people, everyone, a crowd, an army, soldiers or people running, show that " +
  "crowd or force, made of unnamed people who are not the main cast.\n" +
  "- NO TEXT IN THE PROMPT BODY: never describe captions, letters, numbers, signs, posters, banners, newspapers, book " +
  "pages, screens with writing, labels or logos. All story lettering belongs ONLY in DIALOGUE and NARRATION below.\n" +
  "- SHORT / NEARLY EMPTY LINES (critical): some lines are very short — a shout, a name, one word, a reaction, or a " +
  "silent beat with almost no words. Such a line has NO new setting of its own, so you MUST hold the SAME place, the " +
  "SAME people and the SAME time of day as the surrounding lines, and change only the camera or the person's acting. " +
  "A close-up or extreme close-up is appropriate when the short line's primary event is an intense facial reaction. " +
  "NEVER invent a new location, new characters, a new era or an unrelated event for a short line, and never jump to a " +
  "scene the script does not have. When such a line is marked with CONTEXT below, take its place and people from that " +
  "context verbatim.\n" +
  "- 65 to 95 words each — put the exact visible action, named cast and place in the FIRST sentence. Keep every word visual and load-bearing. English only. The image engine gives the beginning much more weight, so never open with mood, history or explanation.\n" +
  "\nFRAMES + LETTERING TAIL (required on every prompt). After the prompt body, append this exact tail:\n" +
  "|| FRAMES: n || BEATS: 1) ... ; 2) ... || DIALOGUE: 1) Name: spoken line ; 2) NONE || NARRATION: 1) story text ; 2) NONE\n" +
  "- FRAMES is how many comic frames that ONE timestamp is drawn as. Hard ceiling by length: under 5s = 1, 5-9s = 2, " +
  "9-15s = 3, over 15s = 4. Count the timestamp's separate sentences and consecutive visible actions. When a timestamp " +
  "has two or more such story moments, FRAMES MUST be at least that count up to its duration ceiling; never collapse a " +
  "multi-sentence timestamp to one frame. A genuinely single-moment timestamp stays one frame however long it lasts.\n" +
  "- BEATS: write one only when FRAMES is 2 or more — exactly FRAMES short phrases (4-12 words each), in story order, " +
  "each the visible action of that frame, all in the SAME place with the SAME characters. Omit BEATS when FRAMES is 1.\n" +
  "- DIALOGUE: exactly FRAMES entries. For a frame where someone SPEAKS or SHOUTS in the script line, give the speaker's " +
  "name, a colon, then that speech translated into short natural spoken ENGLISH (max 12 words, no quotation marks, no " +
  "Hindi, no transliteration, keep the emotion — a shout stays a shout). If the script line is narration, description " +
  "or silence with no spoken words, write NONE for that frame. Never invent dialogue that the script does not speak.\n" +
  "- NARRATION: exactly FRAMES entries. Preserve the remaining non-spoken story from this timestamp as concise, natural " +
  "ENGLISH webtoon narration (max 20 words per box). Use NONE only when that frame is fully communicated by spoken dialogue " +
  "or contains no narrative wording. Translate faithfully: do not discard exposition, inner narration, time/place transitions " +
  "or story context, and do not turn spoken dialogue into narration. For multi-frame timestamps, divide the narration across " +
  "the matching beats without repeating or padding it.\n" +
  "OUTPUT FORMAT (strict about the shape, nothing else): one plain line per requested script line, each starting with " +
  "that script line's own number, then ') ', then the whole prompt AND its tail on that same single line. Example:\n" +
  "37) In the sunlit courtyard, Henan steps back ... || FRAMES: 1 || DIALOGUE: 1) Henan: Stay back! || NARRATION: 1) NONE\n" +
  "38) In the same courtyard, Henan turns ... || FRAMES: 2 || BEATS: 1) Henan turns towards the gate ; 2) he draws his " +
  "blade in one sweep || DIALOGUE: 1) NONE ; 2) Henan: Who sent you? || NARRATION: 1) At dusk, danger found him again. ; 2) NONE\n" +
